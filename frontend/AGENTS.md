# Application description
LM-CE is an AI-powered software application for checking compliance of packaged commodities with the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011. The system will scan product images and labels, extract mandatory declarations using OCR and AI, validate them using a rule-based compliance engine, identify violations, store supporting evidence, and generate digital compliance reports.

# CRITICAL RULES - RESPONSES MUST FOLLOW
- Keep responses concise and to the point unless user asks otherwise.
## PLANNING MODE
- Always ask clarifying questions unless the user asks otherwise
- Never assume design, tech stack or features
- Use deep-dive sub-agents to review the different aspects of your plan before presenting to the user
## CHANGE / EDIT MODE
- Never implement features yourself when possible - use sub-agents!
- Identify changes from the plan that can be implemented in parallel, and use sub-agents to implement the features efficiently
- When using sub-agents to implement features, act as a coordinator only
- Use the best model for the task - premium models for complex tasks (like coding) and mid-tier models for simpler tasks, like documentation
- After completing features (large or small), always run commands like lint, type check and next build to check code quality

## UI Design
- Keep the UI consistent across all pages in the app. Refer to the auth/dashboard page whenever creating a new component or page so that the UI and component design, overall style, color pallete and typography is consistent across all pages.

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
